    ///   main song; the single is primarily released to get radio play and to promote release
    ///   sales.
    /// * The U.K. market (also Australia and Europe) is similar to the US market, however singles
    ///   are often released as a two disc set, with each disc sold separately. They also sometimes
    ///   have a longer version of the single (often combining the tracks from the two disc
    ///   version) which is very similar to the US style single, and this is referred to as a
    ///   "maxi-single". (In some cases the maxi-single is longer than the release the single comes
    ///   from!)
    /// * The Japanese market is much more single driven. The defining factor is typically the
    ///   length of the single and the price it is sold at. Up until 1995 it was common that these
    ///   singles would be released using a mini-cd format, which is basically a much smaller CD
    ///   typically 8 cm in diameter. Around 1995 the 8cm single was phased out, and the standard
    ///   12cm CD single is more common now; generally re-releases of singles from pre-1995 will be
    ///   released on the 12cm format, even if they were originally released on the 8cm format.
    ///   Japanese singles often come with karaoke ("instrumental") versions of the songs and also
    ///   have maxi-singles like the UK with remixed versions of the songs. Sometimes a maxi-single
    ///   will have more tracks than an EP but as it's all alternate versions of the same 2-3 songs
    ///   it is still classified as a single.
